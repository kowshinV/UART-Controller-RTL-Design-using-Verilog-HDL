## 📡 UART Controller – RTL Design (Verilog HDL)

---

📌 Project Overview
* This repository contains the RTL design and verification of a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter) implemented using Verilog HDL.
* The design demonstrates reliable parallel-to-serial transmission and serial-to-parallel reception using asynchronous communication.
* This project was developed as a first industry-oriented VLSI RTL project and verified using Synopsys VCS and DVE.

---

🎯 Key Objectives
* Understand UART protocol fundamentals
* Design UART TX and RX at RTL level
* Implement baud rate–based timing control
* Verify functionality through waveform analysis
* Gain hands-on experience with Synopsys tools

⚙️ UART Specifications
* Communication Type: Asynchronous serial
* Data Width: 8 bits
* Frame Format: 1 Start bit, 8 Data bits, 1 Stop bit
* Bit Order: LSB first
* Error Handling: Not included (ideal conditions)

🧱 Architecture Overview
The UART controller consists of the following blocks:
* Baud Rate Generator – Generates timing tick for UART operation
* UART Transmitter (TX) – Converts parallel data to serial format
* UART Receiver (RX) – Converts serial data back to parallel format
* Top Module – Integrates all UART sub-blocks
* Testbench – Verifies TX–RX loopback functionality
